# arduino-plotter
Code for an Arduino plotter using stepper motors

This is the software half of a complete 2D plotter that comes prebuilt with functions that will help you write letters and draw some simple shapes.
I order for you to build such a project, you will require an Arduino board, some shield board to control the motors and 2 stepper motors that will do the XY movement. The Arduino board and the motor shield can be found in most electronics enthusiast stores, as do the motors themselves (however, please note that any old stepper motor from a DVD or CD bay will work the same way, if you're willing to learn a bit about wiring and soldering)
The code is, by my standard, pretty well commented, as such any variables that you wish to modify (size of the paper, speed of writing etc.) are pretty obvious.
